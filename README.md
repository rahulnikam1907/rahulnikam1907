👋 Hi, I'm Rahul Nikam
I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Michigan, working in the field of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. I hold a PhD in Computational Biology from IIT Madras, where I developed tools like Seq2Feature, DeepBSRPred, and ProThermDB under the mentorship of Prof. M. Michael Gromiha.

My research focuses on:

Protein–protein interaction prediction

Binding affinity analysis

Metagenomics & metatranscriptomics

Machine learning & deep learning applications in biology

🧬 I'm passionate about combining biology, code, and data to understand complex biological systems.

🛠 Tools & Languages
Python, R, Snakemake, Nextflow

Bioconductor, DESeq2, QIIME2, scikit-learn, PyTorch

RNA-Seq, WGS, and microbiome analysis pipelines

📌 Notable Projects
🔬 Seq2Feature: Sequence-to-feature extraction tool for machine learning

🔍 DeepBSRPred: Deep learning-based binding sites predictor

📊 ProThermDB: Database of thermodynamic data for protein mutations

🌱 Currently Exploring
Microbiome shifts across age and gender

Metatranscriptome analysis of human oral samples
